# Bike Share Analysis

This project explores publicly available bike-share data from Chicago, released by the NYC-based bike-share systems operator, Motivate International. We consider a fictional scenario and look to identify rider patterns. While the accopanying dataset file was unfortunately too large to upload here, the main analysis and accompanying explanations are presented as a jupyter notebook in the `bike-share-analysis.ipynb` file. I've also written corresponding SQL queries and created charts using Excel.
